Description of my experience and my current projects

I am a manager with 7+ years of experience. Having the privilege to work for companies such as Subway and CSL. Which allowed me to boost my soft skills in communication, teamwork, time management, patience, and innovation.   

As someone who is aspiring to break into the data field, I have experience working with data with SQL, Tableau, and the whole of the Microsoft suite (specifically Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint, Word, etcetera). 

I am not currently working on any projects, however I did just finish a project- Zomato Sales. Please feel free to peruse the project and any of my other completed projects.
